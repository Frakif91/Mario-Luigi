# Mario & Luigi : Hotel Mania
 From @SLG64 >> "This game is currently a work in progress. My idea for it was to be like an online multiplayer version of M&L, with hotel rooms as lobbies and stuff. The player can earn coins to purchase cosmetics and decorations for their room. There will be a story mode, and a hang out mode. You can also engage in battles with other players if you would like. I will gladly take any help to expand on this game."

SLG64 here. 
I would like to explain it a bit better, then list out the contents for an easier read. Hotel Mania was an idea I had back in 2022, a little (3 years) while after Alphadream went bankrupt. (I am still salty with Nintendo, mainly because they didn't try to buy the company or save it.) I attempted to learn how to code, which I now do. However, I am not coding out the functions for the game, and I am glad I don't have to. You see, my expertise in coding would lead to thousands of bugs, and therefore, I work on designing things. You can find the original resporitory on GitHub. Eventually, I had forgotten about it until boredom hit me. I had nothing to do, but was in plenty of M&L fan game servers on Discord. I decided it was time to build a crew of willing people to help. I created the server for it. I then asked if anyone wanted to help, and Frakif was the first person to start working on it. I was pretty surprised to find out that he wanted to help, mainly because I had never interacted with him before. Of course, I gladly invited him to the Hotel Mania Discord server. If memory serves me correctly, and if he considers it the same way, BrawlTest became my friend. Anyways, now that the backstory is done, here's what Hotel Mania would try to feature:

- Story Mode
  - I think there is a decent story for the game, but it can be revamped if neccesary. The general story can be found on Discord, and I should mention that I had help from AI to create a small portion of the story.

- Online Mode
  - I had this grand thought to make some form of socializing part of the game, which would allow player interaction, cooperative gameplay, and many interesting concepts to come.

- Cosmetics
  - These will be costumes and stuff that you can get at an in-game store that would use Coins and Mushroom Tokens. I am still working on the design for Mushroom Tokens, which would technically just be a Mushroom Coin. Not very interesting, to be honest.

- Item Shop
  - You can get Allies, Cosmetics, Pets, Upgrades, Items, etc. Purchase Items using Coins and Mushroom Tokens.

- Boss Fights
  -Only have two ideas already, we need 10-15 total. One of them is the Final Fight with a certain character, which I would rather not say his name yet. Join the Discord if you want to possibly find his name.

- Items
  - Hammers, Mushrooms, etc. I hope we can make a lot of cool strategies for the game. I did find a super cool concept for a Cloud Flower, which I would gladly use, especially since it's my favorite Power-Up in the series.

- Level Design
  - Not a lot of work so far... However, we do have a design for the training area. I would show an image, but you could find that on the Discord.

- Collectables
  - Mushroom Tokens and the Gemstar. Oh, and Coins. What? It's all I can think of! WAIT-

- Music and Sounds
  - We now have a few composers for the music! We are still looking for any extra people to help, whether that be sound or music. I would insert a video of something they composed, but it should be in the files somewhere.

- NPCs and characters
  - It would be nice to have the development team as NPCs, and I have 5 enemy designs. We need more NPCs and enemies... And... Since this is a "Multiversal" Hotel, we could potentially use your Mario OCs for our game. I honestly have no problem with it. Plus, I get to see new characters and learn more about the community!

- Quests?
  - We need to work on these as well. There isn't anything yet, mainly because the level design isn't made completely.

Anyways, that is the majority of the list I have made, so that's that.

## Progress
We have a decent amount of progress done, all thanks to BrawlTest. I have attempted to make some sprites, for a fresh new look, since we are using Dream Team styled sprites. I will list of the assets and their progress bars below:

- Font
  - A font has been selected (Mario Luigi 2), which looks nice. I think we should incorprate some extra fonts for customizeability features, especially since some players might want a diffent style to the game.

PROGRESS:

Font Customizability: ______________________ 0% Complete
Custom Fonts Imported: 1/1 Fonts

- Sprites
  - I am currently working on making sprites, although I am getting side tracked making Deltarune sprites at the time of writing this. I do have a design in place, I just don't think I could completely do it by myself, making thousands of sprites... I need help for that.

PROGRESS:

Sprites Completed: -_____________________ 0.1% Complete
Sprites made: 3/??? Sprites

- Maps
  - I made one map so far, and I am still brainstorming more ideas for maps. I would enjoy some help, if anyone were to help. 

PROGRESS:

Maps Completed: -_____________________ 0.1% Complete
Maps made: 1/??? Maps

## Part of Dreambound Team
Dreambound is our Alphadream Group. Dreambound aims to host fan games for everyone, including, but not limited to, Mario & Luigi games, Paper Mario games, Super Mario Bros. games, etc. 

You can check out Dreambound Team  at: https://youtube.com/@DreamboundTeam

Currently, Dreambound has a decent amount of fan games included, which are in development. Beware, I might miss a vast majority of them, mainly because my memory is not perfect when it comes down to names. The following are included (as of now):

- Mario & Luigi: Hotel Mania
  - That is where you are now. Join the discord! It'll help a lot!

- Mario & Luigi: Superstar Collection
  - Is currently paused, but Hondasvic_ has another project in the works. This new project is smaller, but more manageable.

- Mario & Luigi: Cosmic Connections
  - DysonTheSpike's project. He is currently gathering designs for it.

- Mario and Luigi: Eastern Wonderland
  - Ummm, All I know about this, it's a Tohou (I have no idea if that's right?) Crossover with the Mario & Luigi series.

- Mario Bros. Monochrome World
  - This is an action platformer. I would have to double check this, but Mario is seperated from his friends and Luigi, forcing him to venture forth on his own.

- Paper Mario: Stick to IT!
  - This is a re-creation of Sticker Star's Beta assets, as well as expanding onto the story of that beta.

 Don't worry, there's more, I just have to check again to see all of them.

## Cancelled Projects or Put on Hold
These are projects put on hold or scrapped.

- Mario & Luigi: Forces
  - Seeing as how it was cancelled, there's not a lot to say about it. DonnieTheRabbit had a decent amount of work done on it, but it ended up cancelled.
