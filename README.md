# Mario & Luigi : Hotel Mania
 From @SLG64 >> "This game is currently a work in progress. My idea for it was to be like an online multiplayer version of M&L, with hotel rooms as lobbies and stuff. The player can earn coins to purchase cosmetics and decorations for their room. There will be a story mode, and a hang out mode. You can also engage in battles with other players if you would like. I will gladly take any help to expand on this game."

SLG64 here. I would like to list out the ideas so that it may be easier to read.

- Story Mode
  - I think I made a solid story for the game, but it can be revamped if neccesary.

- Online Mode
  - I had this grand thought to make some form of socializing part of the game, and I have also thought about letting the player build their own hotel.

- Cosmetics
  - These are costumes and stuff that you can get at a in game store that uses Coins and Mushroom Tokens.

- Item Shop
  - You can get Allies, Cosmetics, Pets, Upgrades, Items, etc.

- Boss Fights
  -Only have two ideas already, we need 10-15 total.

- Items
  - Hammers, Mushrooms, etc. I hope we can make a lot of cool strategies for the game.

- Level Design
  - Not a lot of work so far...

- Collectables
  - Mushroom Tokens and the Gemstar

- Music and Sounds
  - We now have one composer for this music! We are still looking for any extra people to help, whether that be sound or music.

- NPCs and characters
  - It would be nice to have the development team as NPCs, and I have 5 enemy designs. We need more NPCs and enemies...

- Quests?
  - We need to work on these as well.

Anyways, that is the majority of the list I have made, so that's that.

You can check out Dreambound Team  at: https://youtube.com/@DreamboundTeam

Currently, Dreambound has a decent amount of fan games included, which are in development. Beware, I might miss a vast majority of them, mainly because my memory is not perfect when it comes down to names. The following are included (as of now):

- Mario & Luigi: Hotel Mania
  - That is where you are now. Join the discord! It'll help a lot!

- Mario & Luigi: Superstar Collection
  - Is currently paused, but Hondasvic_ has another project in the works. This new project is smaller, but more manageable.

- Mario & Luigi: Cosmic Connections
  - DysonTheSpike's project. He is currently gathering designs for it.

- Mario and Luigi: Eastern Wonderland
  - Ummm, All I know about this, it's a Tohou (I have no idea if that's right?) Crossover with the Mario & Luigi series.

- Mario Bros. Monochrome World
  - This is an action platformer. I would have to double check this, but Mario is seperated from his friends and Luigi, forcing him to venture forth on his own.

- Paper Mario: Stick to IT!
  - This is a re-creation of Sticker Star's Beta assets, as well as expanding onto the story of that beta.

## Cancelled Projects or Put on Hold
These are projects put on hold or scrapped.

- Mario & Luigi: Forces
  - Seeing as how it was cancelled, there's not a lot to say about it. DonnieTheRabbit had a decent amount of work done on it, but it ended up cancelled.
